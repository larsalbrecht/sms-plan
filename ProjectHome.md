## Do what ##
SMS-Plan is an app to send automatically sms to contacts or numbers. You can set up a sms with Event-Text (generate the text for the sms) and let the sms send automatically at the birthday.
You can also write your own sms text.

## Where created ##
This app was original coded on [Hackathon VHackAndroid in Bremen 2012](http://bremen.gtugs.org/events/vhackandroidbremen) by Lars Albrecht, Cornelius Lilge and Bernhard Vollmer under the name "TerrorSMS". We have taken the third place with this app.

The app was unready and almost not bugfree. So I take the source and I refactored the code and all other (http://code.google.com/p/vhackandroid-bremen/wiki/Projects#TerrorSMS) to publish the app on Google Play Store / Amazon App Shop and other (list in wiki will follow on publish)
